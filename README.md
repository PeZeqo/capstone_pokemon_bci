# Pokemon w/ BCI

This is the github repo for our capstone project and should serve as the main source for completed work. This is also a great way for us to contribute to the project and test additions in new branchs.

## Getting Started

You should clone the master branch to your personal computer. Get a fresh install of python 3.8 if you don't already have one, the build script will assume that "python" in your terminal is mapped to Python 3.8 on your computer.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8
